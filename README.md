# First Steps: Repo & Project Setup
* Create your own repository to store this project and all of your work.  
* **Fork** or **Clone** this repository (**GroovyPaymentApp-Senior**) to your local machine, and then push your work to your repository using the instructions and CLI commands below for guidance:  

```
# Fork this project, and clone your fork to your local machine
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git

# To make a full copy (duplicate) of this repo without forking:
# Navigate to your Github dashboard. Go to 'Your Repositories'.
# Create a New Repository. Name it anything you'd like.
# You can make it public or private.
# Do not initialize the repository with a README.
# Do not add a .gitignore. Do not add a license.

# Clone this source repo onto your local machine.
git clone git@github.com:HelloImKevo/GroovyPaymentApp-Senior.git

# Navigate into the new Git project directory.
cd GroovyPaymentApp-Senior

# Check what the current remote repository URL is:
git config --get remote.origin.url

# Change the remote repository URL to your personal repository:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
git config --get remote.origin.url

# Push the entire contents of the Groovy Mobile Payments project to your personal repository:
git push

# If you want to validate your Git environment is set up correctly, make a change to any file, then:
git add .
git commit -a -m "Minor update to <file_name> file"

# Should say something like 'Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit'.
git status

# Push your new commit to your remote Git repository for funsies.
git push
```  

* More repository management discussions:  
  * Forking: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
  * Duplicating: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18200248/cloning-a-repo-from-someone-elses-github-and-pushing-it-to-a-repo-on-my-github
* Your repository can be **public** or **private**, but if it's private you'll need to adjust the repository settings to invite one or two of us as collaborators so we can review your commits.  

#### Pull Requests and Code Review  
* This is **optional**, but if you want good feedback on your submitted solutions you can create a **Pull Request** (in _your_ repository) and notify us when it is ready for review. There's an example Pull Request in **this** repository for reference: https://github.com/HelloImKevo/GroovyPaymentApp-Senior/pull/2  
* Additional information can be found under the [Git Workflow References](#git-workflow-references) section.

#### Stripe SDK Setup  
* Create a **Stripe Developer Account** over at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register  
* Grab your **Publishable** and **Secret** API keys from your dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys  
* The Stripe SDK architecture is built around the expectation of using a Client-Server model, where the Client (Mobile App) uses a **Publishable** API key, and the Server uses a **Secret** API key to generate a **Client Secret** string. We don't have a Server for this test application, so we emulate the "Server" within our app. The Android and iOS applications both use asynchronous utilities for generating a **Client Secret** using the Stripe **Secret** API key.

### [[ iOS Project Setup & Code Style ]](iOS/README.md)

# Expectations
* Okay, **phew**. If you made it this far, you're in good shape :+1: hopefully that stuff didn't take too much time (it gets easier with practice).  
* This project is comes with a **[Business Requirements Document (BRD)](#business-requirements-document-brd)** that is modeled after real-world business requirements. It is effectively a coding assessment designed to help us identify your **Skills** and **Areas of Expertise** and **Attention to Detail**, while providing you a little bit of exposure to the payments industry and our **Git Workflow**.  
* We recommend spending **about 8 Hours** implementing solutions to any number of the [Business Requirements](#business-requirements-document-brd) listed below, but you are welcome to spend as much time as you'd like to accomplish any number of the tasks.  
* It is suggested that you work on tasks that demonstrate your strengths as a developer. For example, if you've got a lot of familiarity with **Encryption & Decryption** mechanisms, you might want to implement an encryption framework for the `User.Password` model data for the login flow. Alternatively, if you enjoy working with multi-threaded systems, feel free to rewrite the **SQL Database** implementation or the asynchronous network calls to the Stripe API.  

# Submission Review Guidelines  
* After you push commits to the project, our team will **Review** your work and provide **Constructive Feedback** on how to improve your code readability, code organization, your approach to solving the problem, or sometimes we will just banter about random technology trends or the latest data breaches :grimacing:  
* Oftentimes, code style is **Subjective**, and there's no right or wrong answer, and that's okay! If you disagree with our feedback, let us know why you wrote it that way - we look forward to learning new things and better practices from you :grin:  
* Code style and consistency is important to us - we take pride in every line of code we write, and encourage you to do the same. The **Android** team generally adheres to all AOSP Contributor Guidelines (See: [Android README](Android/README.md)) and the **iOS** team generally adheres to all iOS Contributor Guidelines (See: [iOS README](iOS/README.md)).  
* Android submissions can be written in **Kotlin** or **Java**.  
* iOS submissions can be written in **Swift** or **Objective-C**.  
* We are more interested in the **Quality** of your submissions, rather than the quantity of submissions.  Quality is assessed using some of these parameters:  
  * Is the **Code Style** consistent? (Do variables follow the same standard conventions? Is the code formatted with the same indentation levels?)  
  * Is the **Git History** clean and well-organized? Can we run a `git log --oneline` and figure out how the candidate implemented their solution for the task? Recommended reading: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
  * Are the methods / functions designed to be small and **Focused**? (It is, however, recognized that long methods are sometimes appropriate.)  
  * Is complex or obscure logic **Documented**? Are comments used effectively?  
  * Does the **Code Architecture** follow recommended developer patterns?  
  * Does the Android code use K&R bracing style? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style  
  * Does the iOS code use Allman bracing style? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style  
* Like many other successful companies, we aim to follow a **Test-Driven Development** paradigm. Unit Tests and Instrumentation tests are strongly encouraged!  

# Questions or Concerns?  
* For any company-related or interview-related questions, reach out to your point-of-contact (likely a **Hiring Manager**).  
* If you would like to keep your work in a **private repository**, please notify the **Hiring Manager**, and they will provide you a list of email addresses for the code reviewers that you'll need to invite as collaborators to your repository.  
* If you have **technical questions** or need assistance with this project, ask the **Hiring Manager**, and they will provide you with the email addresses of one of our team members, and you can email us your question directly, and we will do our best to help.  

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)  

## Task ID: #002 - Generating Test Data & Populating the Database
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 2 Hours  

| Requirements | Code Sample |
| :--- | :---: |
| Generate a few database records to work with. At a minimum we need one <br>`ProductEntity` record (this is already being generated), but it would be <br>beneficial to have a couple `TaxEntity`, `ProductTaxEntityJunction`, <br>`CartEntity` and `CartProductEntity` records to provide data for our views. <br><br>:warning: Check out the: `com.imobile3.groovypayments.data.GroovyDemoManager` class. <br><br>Additionally, you might want to create some `UserEntity` records for the **User Database Schema & Password Encryption** tasks. | ![Client Secret](ScreenMocks/Groovy-20-DatabaseTestDataCode.png) |

## Task ID: #003 - Product List Facelift  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 2 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Users of this application have complained that the Product list looks very <br>bland. (We've gotten lots of negative feedback on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store)<br><br>Update the style of the products to match this new mock from the Design <br>team as closely as possible (or use your creativity to implement a better design). | ![Order Entry](ScreenMocks/Groovy-13-OrderEntry.png) |

## Task ID: #004 - Language Translation of Your Choice
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 2 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Google Play Store users have left us lots of negative feedback because the <br>application only supports English and Spanish.<br><br>For this task, localize all of the app's string resources to another language<br>of your choice. Go through the app and extract any hard-coded strings as necessary.<br><br>:warning: **You do not need to worry about the names and descriptions of database entities.** | ![Spanish](ScreenMocks/Groovy-09-Spanish.png) |
| The system language can be changed at Runtime under System settings. | ![System Language](ScreenMocks/Groovy-07-SystemLanguage.png) |

## Task ID: #005 - Database-Driven Payment Types  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 4 Hours  

## Task ID: #006 - Display the Order History  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 3 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Load the `Cart` models from the database and display them in Order History. | ![Order Entry](ScreenMocks/Groovy-12-OrderHistory.png) |

## Task ID: #007 - Checkout with Cash Payments!  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 4 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Currently, there is no way to complete the Checkout flow, because we <br>haven't implemented **Cash** or Credit support. The "Pay with Cash" screen has <br>a 10-digit Keypad, but it isn't wired up. <br><br>:warning: **Bonus points for allowing the User to over-pay or under-pay, and <br>show the User how much Change is Due to the Customer.** | ![Checkout with Cash](ScreenMocks/Groovy-14-CheckoutCash.png) |

## Task ID: #008 - Generate the Client Secret... On the Client!  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 2 Hours  

| Requirements | Code Sample / Business Mock |
| :--- | :---: |
| We don't have a Server for this test application, so we <br>emulate the "Server" within our app. The Android and <br>iOS applications both use asynchronous utilities for generating <br>a **Client Secret** using your Stripe **Secret** API key. <br>Most of the necessary code already exists, and there is an **Instrumentation Test** <br>available for you to get an idea of how this works - you just need to call our asynchronous <br>method and handle the resulting callbacks. | ![Client Secret](ScreenMocks/Groovy-19-ClientSecretCode.png) |
| Be sure to gracefully handle any errors that might occur. | ![Error](ScreenMocks/Groovy-15-ClientSecretError.png) |

## Task ID: #009 - Pay with a Credit Card Number  
#### Depends on Client Secret mechanism  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 4 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Currently, there is no way to complete the Checkout flow, because we <br>haven't implemented Cash or **Credit** support. The "Pay with Credit" screen <br>has a Stripe `CardInputWidget`, but it isn't wired up. <br><br>Every Stripe payment requires a **Client Secret** string to be generated (the <br>**Client Secret** is derived from the transaction amount, the currency type, and your <br>**Publishable API Key**), so you'll need to generate a **Client Secret** when the User <br>clicks the `PAY (CREDIT)` button, and then process the payment using <br>`com.stripe.android.Stripe.confirmPayment()`. <br><br>References: <br>https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#android  <br>https://stripe.com/docs/testing   | ![Checkout with Credit](ScreenMocks/Groovy-17-CheckoutCredit.png) |
| Consider logging or displaying the response from Stripe. | ![Credit Success](ScreenMocks/Groovy-16-StripeCreditSuccess.png) |

## Task ID: #010 - Navigate to the Checkout Complete Screen  
#### Depends on Pay with Cash or Pay with Credit implementation  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 2 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| When the Customer finishes paying for the Order, navigate to the <br>Checkout Complete screen. | ![Checkout Complete](ScreenMocks/Groovy-18-CheckoutComplete.png) |

## Task ID: #011 - User Database Schema & Proper Login  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 6 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Generate some `UserEntity` records and implement a proper login flow! | ![Login](ScreenMocks/Groovy-01-Login.png) |
| Show details about the currently logged in **User** on the User Profile screen. | ![User Profile](ScreenMocks/Groovy-10-UserProfile.png) |

## Task ID: #012 - User Password Encryption & Decryption  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 6 Hours  

## Task ID: #013 - Tables, and Charts, and Graphs, Oh My!  
#### Estimated LOE (Level of Effort): 6 Hours  

| Requirements | Business Mock |
| :--- | --- |
| Use any open-source Charts & Graphs library to represent any type of data you'd like. <br><br>References: <br>https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart  <br>https://github.com/AnyChart/AnyChart-Android    | ![Daily Reports](ScreenMocks/Groovy-21-DailyReports.png) |
